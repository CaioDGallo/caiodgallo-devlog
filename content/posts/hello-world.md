## About me

Hi, my name is Caio Delafiori Gallo, I am a software engineer and enthusiast. I work mostly with web technologies and I want to start writting blog posts to document my journey throught this infinite world of software dev.

### PHP - love and uncertainty

I work mainly with PHP today. Most people on the internet have a very *strong* opinion on it (not always supported by facts), and I also have my own. I do love PHP but I don't feel it will be where my future belongs, I am deeply in love with the idea of working with GoLang since the first times I started tinkering with it.
